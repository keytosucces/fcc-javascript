// Setup
const myArray = [];

// Only change code below this line
for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
  myArray.push(i);
}
console.log(myArray);

/* In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final expression.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now have the value [0, 1, 2, 3, 4].

Use a for loop to push the values 1 through 5 onto myArray. */
